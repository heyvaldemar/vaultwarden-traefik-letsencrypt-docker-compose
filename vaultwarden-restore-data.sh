# Replaces Vaultwarden's data with one backup set: the data archive and, for each
# SQLite database, the consistent copy the backups service took beside it.
#
#   ./vaultwarden-restore-data.sh                      list the sets and ask
#   ./vaultwarden-restore-data.sh YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm     restore that one
#
# EVERY PATH AND NAME COMES FROM THE RUNNING BACKUPS CONTAINER. The previous
# version carried the compose project, the backup directory and both backup
# names as literals, so any of them set differently in .env pointed it at
# nothing, and it unpacked the archive over the live data: tar does not delete,
# so files created after the backup survived the restore. The end-to-end test
# did the clearing itself, which is how it passed while the script merged.
#
# WHAT THE ARCHIVE LEAVES OUT ON PURPOSE IS KEPT. The loop excludes tmp
# from the archive; those are set aside, the rest is cleared and unpacked, and
# they are put back.
#
# CI runs this exact file.
#
# Set COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME if the stack was started with a -p other than vaultwarden.
